# Drupalgeddon 2

MSF exploit module for Drupalgeddon 2 (CVE-2018-7600 / SA-CORE-2018-002)

Drupal before 7.58, 8.x before 8.3.9, 8.4.x before 8.4.6, and 8.5.x before 8.5.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an issue affecting multiple subsystems with default or common module configurations.

The module can load msf PHP arch payloads, using the php/base64 encoder.

The resulting RCE on Drupal looks like this:

```
php -r 'eval(base64_decode(#{PAYLOAD}));'
```

Developed during Madrid Hack&Beers.
